\note{
For consistency, I would not use several slides to present this content. I am not a fan of that. What is your opinion? \\

What do we approximate? \\

I suggest not to ask questions in the slide, just answer them and mention the questions in your talk (consistency)\\

We should try to have the same layout for our graphics. I thought that LaTeX does this one its own....
