\frametitle{Motivation}


\begin{itemize}
\item steering a car 
\item minimize fuel consumption
\item constraints
\begin{itemize}
\item avoid crashes
\item dynamics
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{block}{Problem}
Dynamics change considerably, e.g., for different weather.
\bigskip \\
\MVRightarrow \ Robust Optimization
\end{block}

\note{
\begin{itemize}
\item Our goal is to steer a car such that the fuel consumption is minimal 
\item Contraints: Avoid Crashes
\begin{itemize}
\item our car is not allowed to leave the road
\item hit other cars or construction sites
\end{itemize}
\item Dynamics of the car
\begin{itemize}
\item motion of the car
\begin{itemize}
\item slipping behavior 
\item acceleration behavior
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Problem: Changing weather has a major impact on the slipping behavior
\begin{itemize}
\item we cannot drive fast on icy roads
\item Rain causes aquaplaning
\end{itemize}
\item Way out: Robust Optimization
\begin{itemize}
\item This Optimization method takes changing parameters such as weather into account.
\item Car is steered save for changing conditions such as weather, different roads...
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
